	 <h1> THE MAX V STORY </h1>
	 <p> The dedication to small batch winemaking was the catalyst to producing the MAX V. The ability to capture the essence of a blend through the handcrafting of many unique individual parcels was a challenge that would lead to a distinctive product.</p>
	<p>Complexity and diversity was the driving force in creating the perfect blend that was regionally specific with a combination of tastes and techniques from old world Bordeaux through to new world Clare Valley. The wine would be produced from the ideal region by a team who shared technical brilliance and a life long affiliation with the land.</p>
	<p>After many years of research and industry experience, Robertson of Clare Wines released in 2007, the MAX V. A Bordeaux style blend using 5 of the noble varieties, combining the 5th generation winemaking experience of Simon Gilbert and top Clare Valley wine grower Leigh Eldredge to produce a wine inspired by difference, quality and diversity. </p>
	<p>The fruit for MAX V has been chosen from specific sites in the Clare Valley suited to, and reflecting the best characteristics for each variety, as well as home to some of the oldest vines planted in the Clare Valley. Each variety was vinified seperately from the fruit thinning to the hand selecting prior to being crushed.</p>
	<p>Each component of MAX V has also been adopted to ensure quality, from the open top Mintaro slate fermenters and Tonnellerie Baron Vinification Integrale to the 19 different types of carefully selected 100% new French barrels from the forests of Troncais, Allier, Vosges, Indre Et Loire and Nevers. </p>
	<p>Robertson of Clare Wines welcomes you to a new experience, combining the vinification techniques from Tonnellerire Baron one of France's oldest cooperages and the terroir of the Clare Valley that produces only <span class="bold">3% of Australia's total grape crush but wins over 20% of all the Australian wine awards</span>. </p>
	<p>Handcrafted to engage precisely the energy and passion behind a wine that is unique, and that captures old and new world philosophies.</p>

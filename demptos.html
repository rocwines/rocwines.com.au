		<p>Founded in 1825, Tonnellerie Demptos has forged its expertise over two hundred years, building on experience and new developments. The Demptos family have long been coopers from father to son, and have acquired a deep understanding of their trade from close contact with Bordeaux wine Chateaux. </p>
	 <p><span class="bold">FINEST QUALITY FRENCH OAK </span><br />
	   To obtain outstanding organoleptic characteristics, Demptos barrels and casks are coopered only from oak from the best French forests. Carefully selected French oak is famous around the world for the extraordinary way in which it conserves and improves wine. </p>
	 <p>A successful barrel starts out its existence from a special moment, when years of experience takes in the fine grain of oak nearly two centuries old, and when a practiced hand ascertains the quality of the bark, the fibre, and the tannins. A look at the soil enables the cooper to evaluate the oak's growth rate and the resulting fineness of the grain. All these parameters have a direct influence on the wood's structure and texture. </p>
	 <p>After selected oak trees have been felled, the logs are stored for almost a year. They are then split along the grain, respecting the character of the wood, and ensuring that it maintains its watertight qualities. After re-splitting and shaping, the trunks are split again and shaped to become staves. Only the choicest part of the merrain is used and keeping back only the best part paves the road to excellence and perfection. </p>
	 <p>From this point on, a sort of alchemy begins that takes 2 years to complete: a metamorphosis in which sun, wind and rain have an important role to play. The physical wood becomes tender, ages and dries out and the chemical wood loses its bitterness. Once an art, it has also become a science and Tonnellerie Demptos has an increasingly precise control of natural wood drying and craftsmanship though a research program established with the help of the Bordeaux Institute of Enology and headed by Dr. Nicolas Vivas </p>
	 <p><span class="bold">INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS </span><br />
	   Although Demptos is deeply rooted in the Bordeaux wine country, it has long had links with Europe, United States, South America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Those vineyards are all different but have chosen Tonnellerie Demptos for their ability to reveal the specific characteristics of their wines and share the same quest for producing the best possible wine. </p>

The variation in slopes also allows for excellent drainage and an ideal environment to control vine vigour.</td>

	<p><span class="bold">GROWERS STATEMENT<br />
	    </span> Cabernet Sauvignon is well suited to both hot and cool climate regions, which are demonstrated through differing vintages in the Clare Valley. Uniquely the Clare Valley is statistically a warm to hot climate wine region, but the impact and influence of the St. Vincent gulf stream is expressed in the length and depth of the Cabernet&rsquo;s produced on the Eldredge property. The lifted fruit flavour profile from soft black berry, cherry and black current and raspberry in the warmer vintages to the level of intensity shown through the <span class="bold">minty, cedar, bell pepper and licorice flavours</span> in cooler vintages. In addition the level of acidity in the Clare Valley is the basis for its balance and longevity as well as tannin structure across the palate.</p>
	<p><span class="bold">KEY FRUIT CHARACTERISTICS &ndash; Cabernet Sauvignon</span><br />
If not the king, as many argue, Cabernet Sauvignon is certainly the most successful and popular of the top-quality red wine grapes. It is the primary grape of most of the top vineyards in <span class="bold">Bordeaux's M&eacute;doc</span> and <span class="bold">Graves</span> districts. This reputation for excellence has launched a Cabernet Sauvignon popularity boom around the world. There's been heavy planting (which continues) in Chile, Australia, and Eastern Europe, especially Bulgaria. In addition, Cabernet Sauvignon has begun making inroads into areas of Spain and Italy where local grapes have dominated for centuries. In Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is most often blended with one or more of the following: merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot, or malbec. </p>
